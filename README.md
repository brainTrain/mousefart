Why not?  This was more of a "Hey, what can I do that is more fun than javascript programming?  A jQuery plugin involving farts!"

###Where are your tests?
I did this in 30 minutes (most of it finding the dog poop image), so please don't expect much.


###What do I expect if I fork it?
A very unhygienic fork.
